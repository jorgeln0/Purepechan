This is a repository of information for the Purepecha Language. The information is for our LING073 course and is not meant to be shared publicly yet.

We used a rule-based language documentation tool called apertium. Since the Purepechan language is native to Mexico and has been influenced by and documented in the Spanish language, our team decided to develop the rule based translation from Purepechan to Spanish. After the conclusion of the course, we submitted our work to the apertium GitHub for other users and researchers to expand our work in documenting underresourced languages. Those repositories (TSZ Transducer and lingustic data [apertium-tsz] and TSZ-SPA Translator [apertium-tsz-spa]) have been forked from their the apertium repository. Authors and contributors for those projects are the same as the following.

This is a repository of information for the Purepecha Language. The information is for our LING073 course and is not meant to be shared publicly yet.

We used a rule-based language documentation tool called apertium. Since the Purepechan language is native to Mexico and has been influenced by and documented in the Spanish language, our team decided to develop the rule based translation from Purepechan to Spanish.
